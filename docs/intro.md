:::caution

AstroNvim v1.4.0 has added `stable` and `nightly` update channels. For the time being we have kept the default update channel to `nightly` so that the behavior of AstroNvim doesn't change (this could be considered a breaking change to some). We are planning to make the `stable` channel the default update channel when Neovim v0.8 is released and we tag AstroNvim v2.0.0 to incorporate this "breaking" change.

When using default theme: For MacOS, the default terminal does not have true color support. You wil need to use [iTerm2](https://iterm2.com/) or another [terminal emulator](https://gist.github.com/XVilka/8346728#terminal-emulators) that has true color support.
