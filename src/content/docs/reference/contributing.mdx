## Nightly/Unstable AstroNvim

By default when using the [AstroNvim Template](https://github.com/AstroNvim/template) users get put on the update path of only receiving official, tagged released of AstroNvim. This guarantees the highest level of stability for the end user and avoid random breaking changes as much as possible. When making contributions to AstroNvim such as opening issues, you may want to test unreleased code to see if it resolves any problems or verify if a bug is already fixed. This can be achieved by simply disabling the default version pinning of AstroNvim that is set by the template. This version pinning and configuration will be located wherever you add the `AstroNvim/AstroNvim` repository and import it's plugins. If you are using the official template, this would be located in the file `~/.config/nvim/lua/lazy_setup.lua` (adjusting the path as necessary for your operating system or configuration location). You simply want to remove any reference to specifying a `version` such as this:

::::tip
Remember to restart and run `:Lazy update` after these changes!

```diff lang="lua" title="lua/lazy_setup.lua" collapse={8-12,14-33}
require("lazy").setup({
  {
    "AstroNvim/AstroNvim",
-    version = "^4",    -- Remove version tracking to elect for nightly AstroNvim
+    -- version = "^4", -- Remove version tracking to elect for nightly AstroNvim
    import = "astronvim.plugins",
    opts = { -- AstroNvim options must be set here with the `import` key
      mapleader = " ", -- This ensures the leader key must be configured before Lazy is set up
      maplocalleader = ",", -- This ensures the localleader key must be configured before Lazy is set up
      icons_enabled = true, -- Set to false to disable icons (if no Nerd Font is available)
      pin_plugins = nil, -- Default will pin plugins when tracking `version` of AstroNvim, set to true/false to override
      update_notifications = true, -- Enable/disable notification about running `:Lazy update` twice to update pinned plugins
    },
  },
  { import = "community" },
  { import = "plugins" },
} --[[@as LazySpec]], {
  -- Configure any other `lazy.nvim` configuration options here
  install = { colorscheme = { "astrodark", "habamax" } },
  ui = { backdrop = 100 },
  performance = {
    rtp = {
      -- disable some rtp plugins, add more to your liking
      disabled_plugins = {
        "gzip",
        "netrwPlugin",
        "tarPlugin",
        "tohtml",
