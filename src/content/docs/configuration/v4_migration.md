title: Migration to v4.0
---

While there are many small improvements to AstroNvim in version 4, the major update is a move to to using the [`lazy.nvim`](https://github.com/folke/lazy.nvim) plugin manager for much more of the configuration.

The first major change is that the installation of AstroNvim itself is through using `lazy.nvim`. Rather than cloning AstroNvim, as was done in previous versions, AstroNvim is "just another" plugin and it is installed using `lazy.nvim`.

The second major change is that AstroNvim configuration has been split among a number of plugins, each with their own configuration. While the [AstroNvim](https://github.com/AstroNvim/AstroNvim/tree/v4) plugin is still the main plugin, it has very limited configuration options.

The new plugins are:

- [AstroCore](https://github.com/AstroNvim/astrocore) - Provides a configuration interface for "core" AstroNvim functions, such as key mappings, auto commands, etc. The [configuration here](https://github.com/AstroNvim/astrocore#%EF%B8%8F-configuration) provides an example and `:help astrocore` provides help within Neovim. AstroCore also has an API for utility functions that help with managing and updating your configuration.
- [AstroLSP](https://github.com/AstroNvim/astrolsp) - Provides a configuration interface for Language Server Protocol (LSP) functions. The [configuration here](https://github.com/AstroNvim/astrolsp#%EF%B8%8F-configuration) provides an example and `:help astrolsp` provides help within Neovim.
- [AstroUI](https://github.com/AstroNvim/astroui) - Provides a configuration interface for User Interface (UI) functions, such as setting the colorscheme, highlights, icons, etc. The [configuration here](https://github.com/AstroNvim/astroui#%EF%B8%8F-configuration) provides and example and `:help astroui` provides help within Neovim.

All AstroNvim configuration is coordinated through those plugins above.

## Setting Up a Migration Environment

:::note

Before getting started it is recommended to review the [Getting Started]() guide. The guide explains how AstroNvim uses `lazy.nvim` and it also explains the AstroNvim configuration template, which is the recommended way to migrate from the previous version.

:::

Breaking your working editor configuration when migrating to v4 will make it difficult to edit your new configuration. As such, we **recommend following the process** below so that your existing editor keeps working while migrating to the v4 configuration. This workflow makes use of an [Isolated Installation](/reference/alt_install/#isolated-installation) environment.

1. Clone the AstroNvim v4 configuration template to a new location (`astronvim_v4` is used as the example):

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/AstroNvim/template ~/.config/astronvim_v4
   rm -rf ~/.config/astronvim_v4/.git
   ```

2. Start `nvim` in the new environment. `nvim` should start, bootstrap itself by installing and loading `lazy.nvim`. Lazy will load all of the plugins specified by AstroNvim.

   ```sh
   NVIM_APPNAME=astronvim_v4 nvim
   ```

3. Migrate your AstroNvim v3 configuration to your new AstroNvim v4 environment at `~/.config/astronvim_v4` using the guide below. You can use your previous AstroNvim setup to do the editing and then continue running the command in Step 2 to test the new installation.

4. Once you have your configuration set up how you like it, move it over to the default neovim configuration location `~/.config/nvim`:

   ```sh
   mv ~/.config/nvim ~/.config/nvim.bak # backup old config
   mv ~/.config/astronvim_v4 ~/.config/nvim # move new config
   ```

5. Run your new v4 environment simply with `nvim` ðŸŽ‰

## Configuration Options Migration

:::warning

This is a work in progress. This guide is taking shape and covers much of the migration. There are holes though! If you see something missing drop a note on the Discord `#v4_testing` channel or open a pull request on GitHub.

:::

Each "Migrating" section below has an link to documentation and/or an example configuration. Each example configuration file shows the structure for configuring that plugin. The comments in each example configuration describes the configuration keys.

::: note

**Recommended reading**: for each plugin there is a link to example configuration. These configurations are full of documentation and can help guide your migration!

:::

The [plugin configuration files.](https://github.com/AstroNvim/AstroNvim/tree/v4/lua%2Fastronvim%2Fplugins) in the AstroNvim codebase itself are also a good reference to learn how to configure.

**Please also read the Other Changes section** - there are a number of changes that are not just "move some config from one place to another". For example, in key mapping `<leader>` is no longer recognized.

If you get stuck, people on the [Discord](https://discord.astronvim.com/) forum are active and friendly! Like all humans, sometimes they are grumpy, so be nice to them! The best place to post is most likely the `#help-forum`, but poke around a few of the other channels, you never know what you will find that is useful.

| `plugins`                 | Plugins are in the directory `lua/plugins/<any_files>.lua`                                                                    |

| `commands`      | AstroNvim/astrolsp  | Configure buffer local user commands to add when attaching a language server   |

### Other Changes

::: caution

`mapleader` and `maplocalleader` must be configured either before the `lazy.setup` call or in the `AstroNvim/AstorNvim` `opts` in the `lua/lazy_setup.lua` file due to the way that `lazy.nvim` plugin manager works.

:::

- Mapping modifiers are now capitalized. For example `<leader>` not longer works and must be changed to `<Leader>`.
- `mapleader` and `maplocalleader` can be set in the `AstroNvim/astronvim` configuration spec `opts`
