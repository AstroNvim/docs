title: Migration to v4.0
---

While there are many small improvements to AstroNvim in version 4, the major update is a move to use the [`lazy.nvim`](https://github.com/folke/lazy.nvim) plugin manager for much more of the configuration.

The first major change is that the installation of AstroNvim itself is through `lazy.nvim`. Rather than cloning AstroNvim, as was done in previous versions, AstroNvim is "just another" plugin and it is installed using `lazy.nvim`.

The second major change is that AstroNvim configuration has been split among a number of plugins, each with their own configuration. While the [AstroNvim](https://github.com/AstroNvim/AstroNvim/tree/v4) plugin is still the main plugin, it has very limited configuration options.

The new plugins are:

- [AstroCore](https://github.com/AstroNvim/astrocore) - Provides a configuration interface for "core" AstroNvim functions, such as key mappings, auto commands, etc. The [configuration here](https://github.com/AstroNvim/astrocore#%EF%B8%8F-configuration) provides an example and `:help astrocore` provides help within Neovim. AstroCore also has an API for utility functions that help with managing and updating your configuration.
- [AstroLSP](https://github.com/AstroNvim/astrolsp) - Provides a configuration interface for Language Server Protocol (LSP) functions. The [configuration here](https://github.com/AstroNvim/astrolsp#%EF%B8%8F-configuration) provides an example and `:help astrolsp` provides help within Neovim.
- [AstroUI](https://github.com/AstroNvim/astroui) - Provides a configuration interface for User Interface (UI) functions, such as setting the colorscheme, highlights, icons, etc. The [configuration here](https://github.com/AstroNvim/astroui#%EF%B8%8F-configuration) provides and example and `:help astroui` provides help within Neovim.

All AstroNvim configuration is coordinated through those plugins above.

:::note

Before getting started it is recommended to review the [Getting Started]() guide. The guide explains how AstroNvim uses `lazy.nvim` and it also explains the AstroNvim configuration template, which is the recommended way to migrate from the previous version.

## Setting Up a Migration Environment

Breaking your working editor configuration when migrating to v4 will make it difficult to edit your new configuration. As such, we **recommend following the process** below so that your existing editor keeps working while migrating to the v4 configuration. This workflow makes use of an [Isolated Installation](/reference/alt_install/#isolated-installation) environment.

1. Clone the AstroNvim v4 configuration template to a new location (`astronvim_v4` is used as the example):

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/AstroNvim/template ~/.config/astronvim_v4
   rm -rf ~/.config/astronvim_v4/.git
   ```

2. Start `nvim` in the new environment. `nvim` should start, bootstrap itself by installing and loading `lazy.nvim`. Lazy will load all of the plugins specified by AstroNvim.

   ```sh
   NVIM_APPNAME=astronvim_v4 nvim
   ```

3. Migrate your AstroNvim v3 configuration to your new AstroNvim v4 environment at `~/.config/astronvim_v4` using the guide below. You can use your previous AstroNvim setup to do the editing and then continue running the command in Step 2 to test the new installation.

4. Once you have your configuration set up how you like it, move it over to the default neovim configuration location `~/.config/nvim`:

   ```sh
   mv ~/.config/nvim ~/.config/nvim.bak # backup old config
   mv ~/.config/astronvim_v4 ~/.config/nvim # move new config
   ```

5. Run your new v4 environment simply with `nvim` ðŸŽ‰

## Migration Guide

### Configuration Option Changes

:::caution

This is a work in progress. This guide is taking shape and covers much of the migration. There are holes though! If you see something missing drop a note on the Discord `#v4_testing` channel or open a pull request on GitHub.

:::

Each "Migrating" section below has an link to documentation and/or an example configuration. Each example configuration file shows the structure for configuring that plugin. The comments in each example configuration describes the configuration keys.

:::note

**Recommended reading**: for each plugin there is a link to example configuration. These configurations are full of documentation and can help guide your migration!

:::

The [plugin configuration files.](https://github.com/AstroNvim/AstroNvim/tree/v4/lua%2Fastronvim%2Fplugins) in the AstroNvim codebase itself are also a good reference to learn how to configure.

**Please also read the Other Changes section** - there are a number of changes that are not just "move some config from one place to another". For example, in key mapping `<leader>` is no longer recognized.

If you get stuck, people on the [Discord](https://discord.astronvim.com/) forum are active and friendly! Like all humans, sometimes they are grumpy, so be nice to them! The best place to post is most likely the `#help-forum`, but poke around a few of the other channels, you never know what you will find that is useful.

| `updater`                 | Updating uses `lazy` update features and is configured in `init.lua` using `lazy` `branch` and `version` plugin spec options. |

A few options were configured through global (`vim.g`) variables. These have also been moved to our core configuration plugins:

| `commands` | `AstroNvim/astrolsp`  | Configure buffer local user commands to add when attaching a language server |

### Other Changes

:::caution

`mapleader` and `maplocalleader` must be configured either before the `lazy.setup` call or in the `AstroNvim/AstroNvim` `opts` (This is in the `lua/lazy_setup.lua` file in the official template). This is required due to the way that `lazy.nvim` plugin manager works and how Neovim creates mappings with the leaders.

:::

- Key codes in the keys for the mappings for AstroNvim are now normalized to match the casing in the official vimdocs. For example in v3 our mappings used `<leader>`, but this is now changed to `<Leader>`.
- `mapleader` and `maplocalleader` must be set in the `AstroNvim/AstroNvim` configuration spec `opts` or before the `require("lazy").setup` call in your Neovim configuration.
- TODO: More changes from @mehalter

## Plugin Changes

Along with the new core AstroNvim plugins, we have made some other changes to our plugin list that user's should keep in mind while performing the migration.

- Added:
  - [`AstroNvim/AstroNvim`](https://github.com/AstroNvim/AstroNvim)
    - AstroNvim is now formatted as a plugin that provides plugin specifications to `lazy.nvim` through `import`.
  - [`AstroNvim/astrocore`](https://github.com/AstroNvim/astrocore)
    - The core configuration mechanism for AstroNvim for configuring things such as auto commands, mappings, vim options, session management, etc.
  - [`AstroNvim/astrolsp`](https://github.com/AstroNvim/astrolsp)
    - The core LSP configuration mechanism for AstroNvim which provides a single place of configuration that interfaces between the various LSP plugins.
  - [`AstroNvim/astroui`](https://github.com/AstroNvim/astroui)
    - The UI configuration mechanism for providing a unified interface such as icon and highlight configuration as well as our extensive `status` Lua API for building our `statusline`, `tabline`, `winbar`, and `statuscolumn`
  - [`RRethy/vim-illuminate`](https://github.com/RRethy/vim-illuminate)
    - provides more general and performant highlighting of the word under the cursor. If you were previously removing the `augroup` `lsp_document_highlight`, we are no longer creating that `augroup` and instead you should just disable (or configure) this plugin.
  - [`folke/todo-comments.nvim`](https://github.com/folke/todo-comments.nvim)
    - provides highlighting of known comment strings like `TODO:`.
- Changed:
  - [`jose-elias-alvarez/null-ls.nvim`](https://github.com/jose-elias-alvarez/null-ls.nvim) â†’ [`nvimtools/none-ls.nvim`](https://github.com/nvimtools/none-ls.nvim)
    - `null-ls` was archived by the author and `none-ls` is a maintainer fork. All `require`s are the same, but if you are configuring `null-ls` in your plugins anywhere be sure to update the repository to `nvimtools/none-ls.nvim`.
  - [`Shatur/neovim-session-manager`](https://github.com/Shatur/neovim-session-manager) â†’ [`stevearc/resession.nvim`](https://github.com/stevearc/resession.nvim)
    - `resession.nvim` provides a deeper and more configurable Lua API for building up our session management. This allows us to take into account our tab-local buffers when saving and restoring sessions. Similar to how `heirline` provides a framework for building statuslines, `resession` provides a framework for session management. We have added a few easy to configure options in AstroCore under the `sessions` table in the configuration opts for easily configuring auto saving of sessions and rules for ignoring buffers when saving. For advanced configuration please check out the extensive [Ressesion Documentation](https://github.com/stevearc/resession.nvim/) and our [Session Management Recipes](). TODO: CREATE SESSION MANAGEMENT RECIPE PAGE AND UPDATE THIS LINK @mehalter
- Removed:
  - [`b0o/SchemaStore.nvim`](https://github.com/b0o/SchemaStore.nvim)
    - We are no longer providing `SchemaStore.nvim` out of the box. This will be provided as needed in the AstroCommunity language packs.
