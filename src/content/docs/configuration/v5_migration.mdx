title: Migration to v5.0
---

import { Steps } from "@astrojs/starlight/components";

While AstroNvim v4 came with a large restructuring of the configuration organization, AstroNvim v5 is a much smaller major version release and mainly comes with some modernization of plugins and small quality of life improvements. Most of the migration will only apply to users who have gone and customized the plugins that have been replaced. The plugin replacements come from various reasons such as plugins getting archived (`dressing.nvim`), better performance, more stable development practices, and overall simplification.

:::note

Before getting started it is recommended to review the [Getting Started](/) guide. The guide explains how AstroNvim uses `lazy.nvim` and it also explains the AstroNvim configuration template, which is the recommended way to migrate from the previous version.

## Setting Up a Migration Environment

Breaking your working editor configuration when migrating to v5 will make it difficult to edit your new configuration. As such, we **recommend following the process** below so that your existing editor keeps working while you upgrade to the new v5 configuration. This workflow makes use of an [Isolated Installation](/reference/alt_install/#isolated-installation) environment.

:::tip

Checkout the [Managing User Configuration Page](/configuration/manage_user_config) for details on how to create a new git repository from our template or convert the clone described above into a repository. It is highly recommended to set up your configuration as a git repository so that it is backed up as well as easier to share.

:::

<Steps>

1. Clone the AstroNvim v5 configuration template to a new location (`astronvim_v5` is used as the example):

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/AstroNvim/template ~/.config/astronvim_v5
   rm -rf ~/.config/astronvim_v5/.git
   ```

2. Start `nvim` in the new environment. `nvim` should start, bootstrap itself by installing and loading `lazy.nvim`. Lazy will load all of the plugins specified by AstroNvim.

   ```sh
   NVIM_APPNAME=astronvim_v5 nvim
   ```

3. Migrate your AstroNvim v4 configuration to your new AstroNvim v5 environment at `~/.config/astronvim_v5` using the guide below. You can use your previous AstroNvim setup to do the editing and then continue running the command in Step 2 to test the new installation.

4. Once you have your configuration set up how you like it, move it over to the default neovim configuration location `~/.config/nvim`:

   ```sh
   # Backup old Neovim folders
   mv ~/.local/share/nvim ~/.local/share/nvim.bak # backup old data folder
   mv ~/.local/state/nvim ~/.local/state/nvim.bak # backup old state folder
   mv ~/.cache/nvim ~/.cache/nvim.bak             # backup old cache folder
   mv ~/.config/nvim ~/.config/nvim.bak           # backup old config
   # Move new configuration into place
   mv ~/.config/astronvim_v5 ~/.config/nvim # move new config
   ```

5. Run your new v5 environment simply with `nvim` ðŸŽ‰

## Migration Guide

### Configuration Option Changes

:::caution

This is a work in progress. This guide is taking shape and covers much of the migration. There are holes though! If you see something missing drop a note on the Discord `#next` channel or open a pull request on GitHub.

:::

Each "Migrating" section below has an link to documentation and/or an example configuration. Each example configuration file shows the structure for configuring that plugin. The comments in each example configuration describes the configuration keys.

:::note

**Recommended reading**: for each plugin there is a link to example configuration. These configurations are full of documentation and can help guide your migration!

:::

The [plugin configuration files.](https://github.com/AstroNvim/AstroNvim/tree/main/lua%2Fastronvim%2Fplugins) in the AstroNvim codebase itself are also a good reference to learn how to configure.

**Please also read the [Other Changes section](#other-changes)** - there are a number of changes that are not just "move some config from one place to another". For example, in key mapping `<leader>` is no longer recognized.

If you get stuck, people on the [Discord](https://discord.astronvim.com/) forum are active and friendly! Like all humans, sometimes they are grumpy, so be nice to them! The best place to post is most likely the `#help-forum`, but poke around a few of the other channels, you never know what you will find that is useful.

### Plugin Changes

AstroNvim v5 comes with some changes to our default plugin list that user's should keep in mind while performing the migration.

- Added:
  - [`mason-tool-installer.nvim`](https://github.com/WhoIsSethDaniel/mason-tool-installer.nvim)
    - AstroNvim is now relying on `mason-tool-installer.nvim` rather than `mason-lspconfig`/`mason-nvim-dap`/`mason-null-ls`. This makes configuration of installed packages easier rather than managing several `ensure_installed` tables and also adds support for installing packages automatically that are not part of any of those usecase specific plugins. `mason-tool-installer.nvim` also allows the user to specify specific package versions and other options. Check out the [`mason-tool-installer.nvim` Documentation](https://github.com/WhoIsSethDaniel/mason-tool-installer.nvim) for details on it's configuration.
    - For migration, anywhere in your configuration where you are configuring `ensure_installed` for `mason-lspconfig`/`mason-nvim-dap`/`mason-null-ls`, you should move those to an `ensure_installed` table in `mason-tool-installer.nvim`. You must also change the name of the package where necessary to properly reflect the name of the package in Mason. For instance, if you have `lua_ls` specified for `mason-lspconfig`, this would be `lua-language-server` in `mason-tool-installer.nvim`.

### AstroNvim Core Plugin Changes

#### AstroCore

- The `system_open` function has been removed and any references to `require("astrocore").system_open()` should be replaced with `vim.ui.open()`
- The `features.diagnostics_mode` configuration option has been simplified to just be `features.diagnostics`. This new value is either a boolean (`true`/`false`) to enable/disable diagnostics completely on startup, or it can be a table in the form of `{ virtual_text = true, virtual_lines = false }` to control the display of virtual text/virtual lines on startup. New toggles have been added (`<Leader>uv` and `<Leader>uV`) to toggle the virtual text and virtual lines at runtime. Furthermore the `<Leader>ud` mapping simply enables/disables diagnostics completely rather than managing various different states.

#### AstroLSP

- Configuration of `vim.lsp.buf.hover` and `vim.lsp.buf.signature_help` are no longer configured through the `handlers["textDocument/hover"]` and `handlers["textDocument/signature_help"]` configuration options. This is because of a breaking change in core Neovim where these are no longer configured as such. The options are now configured through a new `defaults` table in the AstroLSP configuration (`defaults.hover` and `defaults.signature_help`). If you have customized those handlers in your configuration, then check the [AstroLSP Documentation](https://github.com/AstroNvim/astrolsp) for where to place those configurations.

#### AstroUI

- Introduction of a new `folding` module for a custom built `foldexpr` function in order to replace `nvim-ufo`. This feature is currently only enabled by default if you are using Neovim v0.11 as this provides LSP based folding out of the box, but if you want to use it with Neovim v0.10 then you can simply disable `nvim-ufo` in your user configuration. When in use, it also exposes a new command, `:AstroFoldInfo` which displays the current fold information. The folding behavior can also be configured through the new `folding` configuration table which can be explored through the [AstroUI Documentation](https://github.com/AstroNvim/astroui) which allows the user to configure when folding is enabled as well as which folding methods are utilized (currently supports treesitter based folding, indentation based folding, and LSP based folding which is Neovim v0.11 only).

### Other Changes

- `AstroMasonUpdate` and `AstroMasonUpdateAll` commands have been removed in favor for the commands provided by [`mason-tool-installer`](https://github.com/WhoIsSethDaniel/mason-tool-installer.nvim)
- The mapping `<C-S>` for saving while in insert mode has been removed as this is now a core Neovim binding for showing signature help.

### New Features

Some changes have been made that do not necessarily require any user intervention during the migration, but are just new features! Here are a few highlights
