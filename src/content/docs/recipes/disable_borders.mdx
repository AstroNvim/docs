title: Disable Borders
---

By default AstroNvim unifies the user interface to utilize rounded borders. If you prefer other border types such as setting borders to `"none"` then you currently must do this for each individual plugin which has configurable borders. This can be easily configured with the `vim.opt.winborder` configuration setting. Here is some example code:

This is available in the [AstroCommunity](https://github.com/AstroNvim/astrocommunity/tree/main/lua/astrocommunity/recipes/disable-borders)

```lua title="lua/community.lua" ins={3}
return {
  "AstroNvim/astrocommunity",
  { import = "astrocommunity.recipes.disable-borders" },
}
```

```lua title="lua/plugins/disable_borders.lua"
return {
  {
    "AstroNvim/astrocore",
    ---@type AstroCoreOpts
    opts = {
      options = {
        opt = {
          winborder = "none",
        },
      },
    },
  },
}
```
