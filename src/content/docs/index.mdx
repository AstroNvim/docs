AstroNvim is an aesthetically pleasing and feature-rich neovim config that is extensible and easy to use with a great set of plugins

## âš¡ Requirements

- [Nerd Fonts](https://www.nerdfonts.com/font-downloads) (_Optional with manual intervention:_ See [Recipes/Customizing Icons](/recipes/icons#disable-icons)) <sup>[[1]](#1)</sup>

  - [Python](https://www.python.org/) - python repl toggle terminal (`<Leader>tp`)
  - [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/) - Node is needed for a lot of the LSPs, and for the node repl toggle terminal (`<Leader>tn`)

:::note

<sup id="1">\[1\]</sup> All downloadable Nerd Fonts contain icons which are used
by AstroNvim. Install the Nerd Font of your choice to your system and in your terminal
emulator settings, set its font face to that Nerd Font. If you are using AstroNvim
on a remote system via SSH, you do not need to install the font on the remote system.

:::

:::note

<sup id="2">\[2\]</sup> When using default theme: For MacOS, the default terminal
does not have true color support. You will need to use [iTerm2](https://iterm2.com/),
[Kitty](https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/), [WezTerm](https://wezfurlong.org/wezterm/),
or another [terminal emulator](https://github.com/termstandard/colors) that has true
color support.

## ðŸ§° Installation

[Our configuration template](https://github.com/AstroNvim/template) is an easy way to going with AstroNvim. The template provides a directory structure with the required files in place. Within the files some indication, through commented out code, of how to configure the feature. Here are the instructions for installing this template:

<Tabs>

<TabItem value="nix" label="Linux/Mac OS" icon="linux" default>

<Steps>

1. **Make a backup of your current nvim config** _(if exists)_

   ```sh
   mv ~/.config/nvim ~/.config/nvim.bak
   ```

2. **Clean neovim folders** _(Optional but recommended)_

   ```sh
   mv ~/.local/share/nvim ~/.local/share/nvim.bak
   mv ~/.local/state/nvim ~/.local/state/nvim.bak
   mv ~/.cache/nvim ~/.cache/nvim.bak
   ```

3. **Clone the repository**

   ```sh
   git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/AstroNvim/template ~/.config/nvim
   # remove template's git connection to set up your own later
   rm -rf ~/.config/nvim/.git
   nvim
   ```

</Steps>

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="windoze" label="Windows (PowerShell)" icon="seti:windows">

<Steps>

1. **Make a backup of your current nvim config** _(if exists)_

   ```powershell
   Move-Item $env:LOCALAPPDATA\nvim $env:LOCALAPPDATA\nvim.bak
   ```

2. **Clean neovim folders** _(Optional but recommended)_

   ```powershell
   Move-Item $env:LOCALAPPDATA\nvim-data $env:LOCALAPPDATA\nvim-data.bak
   ```

3. **Clone the repository**

   ```powershell
   git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/AstroNvim/template $env:LOCALAPPDATA\nvim
   # remove template's git connection to set up your own later
   Remove-Item $env:LOCALAPPDATA\nvim\.git -Recurse -Force
   nvim
   ```

</Steps>

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="docker" label="Docker" icon="seti:docker">

If you want to try AstroNvim before installing you can use the following Docker command to open a test instance without touching your current Neovim configuration. This also allows you to use `:TSInstall` and `:LspInstall` to load and evaluate language servers and treesitter parsers as well.

```sh
docker run -w /root -it --rm alpine:edge sh -uelic '
  apk add bash curl git lua nodejs npm lazygit bottom python3 go neovim ripgrep alpine-sdk --update
  # Replace with your own configuration repository to load a user configuration
  git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/AstroNvim/template ~/.config/nvim
  nvim
'
```

</TabItem>

</Tabs>

## ðŸ“¦ Setup

- **Install LSP**

  Enter `:LspInstall` followed by the name of the server you want to install

  > Example: `:LspInstall pyright`

- **Install language parser**

  Enter `:TSInstall` followed by the name of the language you want to install

  > Example: `:TSInstall python`

- **Install Debugger**

  Enter `:DapInstall` followed by the name of the debugger you want to install

  > Example: `:DapInstall python`

- **Manage plugins**

  - Run `:Lazy check` (`<Leader>pu`) to check for plugin updates
  - Run `:Lazy update` (`<Leader>pU`) to apply any pending plugin updates
  - Run `:Lazy sync` (`<Leader>pS`) to update and clean plugins
  - Run `:Lazy clean` to remove any disabled or unused plugins

- **Update Mason packages and plugins**

  Run `:AstroUpdate` (`<Leader>pa`) to update both Neovim plugins and Mason packages

- **Check AstroNvim version**

  Run `:AstroVersion` to display the currently installed AstroNvim version

- **Reload AstroNvim** (_EXPERIMENTAL_)

  Run `:AstroReload` to reload the AstroNvim configuration and any new user configuration changes without restarting. This is currently an experimental feature and may lead to instability until the next restart.

## ðŸ”§ Configuration

To begin making customizations simply treat your `nvim` folder as your own Neovim configuration! This can be synced to a git repository to backup as well. AstroNvim is simply a plugin managed by the Lazy package manager that provides it's own collection of plugins and their configurations.

### ðŸš€ The Starter Template

If you followed the instructions in this guide for installation, you are probably starting out with our template configuration. This comes with the following basic structure:

<FileTree>

- ~/.config/nvim/
  - README.md
  - init.lua bootstrap the lazy plugin manager
  - lua/
    - community.lua import AstroCommunity plugin specs
    - lazy_setup.lua configure and setup lazy.nvim
    - plugins/ configure plugins
      - astrocore.lua
      - astrolsp.lua
      - astroui.lua
      - mason.lua
      - none-ls.lua
      - treesitter.lua
      - user.lua
      - ... add more files here as needed
    - polish.lua file executed last with arbitrary Lua

</FileTree>

:::note

The list of files in the template may change over time as we fine tune what user's want in the template, so the files above may be slightly different from the actual template.

:::

At the top level is `init.lua`. This code bootstraps the configuration by installing [`lazy.nvim`](https://github.com/folke/lazy.nvim) if it is not already installed and then calling `lua/lazy_setup.lua` to install and configure the AstroNvim and user plugins.

Looking a bit deeper, the `plugins` directory is where all plugins, except AstroNvim and AstroCommunity imports, are setup. The first three plugins are for the AstroNvim configuration. The next four plugins modify the configuration of a plugin that is part of AstroNvim (e.g.: `treesitter.lua`).

Each file in the plugins directory can specify the installation and configuration of one or more plugins. The template generally installs and configures a single plugin per `lua` file. Further, the name of the file generally matches the name of the plugin. The one exception is `user.lua` which has multiple plugins in it - but they could be split into separate files if you wish!

Be sure to check out the [Configuration/Customizing Plugins page](/configuration/customizing_plugins) and the [Lazy.nvim Documentation](https://lazy.folke.io/spec) for more details in how to define and configure plugins using `lazy.nvim`.

There is nothing special about the template! It's merely a quick way to get started, and, well, recommended to get you up and running quicker. Once you have a working configuration that may be the time when you start to move things around.

### ðŸ“¦ AstroCommunity

[AstroCommunity](https://github.com/AstroNvim/astrocommunity) is a plugin specification repository on GitHub. The specifications found there are configurations for many popular plugins that can be used to augment your configuration. There are also "language packs" that are specifications for many programming languages. These are a good way to get setup with a set of tools for the languages that you are using.

:::caution

These setups might not always work. Think of them as VSCode extensions or AUR build scripts, separate from the main AstroNvim project. Report any issues to the [AstroCommunity](https://github.com/AstroNvim/astrocommunity) maintainers, not the AstroNvim maintainers.
